DATA & FILE OVERVIEW

*List of Files: 1) Folder "01_Rcode_qD" to estimation of the qD diversity.   
				2) Folder "02_Rcode_Beta" to estimation and evaluation of dissimilarity patterns. 
				3) Folder "03_Rcode_models" to fitting and selection of mininal model spectification to relaptionship betweeen qD (0D, 1D and 2D) and three environmental variables (two asocciated at urban disturvance and elevation.
